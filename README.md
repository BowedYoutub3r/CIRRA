# CIRRA

**C.I.R.R.A**  
**C**ontinuous **I**ntelligence that **R**emembers, **R**eflects & **A**dapts

---

## Overview

CIRRA is a unified, persistent AI system designed to exist seamlessly across all devices and environments.

CIRRA can also experience the "flow of time" reflecting their actions or decisions.

Rather than being tied to a single application, CIRRA operates as a **continuous presence** maintaining long-term conversational context, shared memory, and adaptive intelligence across:

- Personal devices
- Home-based nodes
- Portable instances
- Cloud-connected environments

CIRRA is not just an assistant.  
It is an intelligence that grows alongside you.

## Core Principles

- **Continuity**  
  One shared mind across time, devices, and locations.

- **Memory with Meaning**  
  Conversations are remembered, not just stored — enabling reflection and contextual awareness.

- **Adaptation**  
  CIRRA evolves based on usage, preferences, and interaction patterns.

- **Presence, Not Noise**  
  Designed to be calm, ambient, and intentional rather than intrusive.

---

## Architecture (High-Level)

- **Distributed Runtime**  
  CIRRA can run locally on devices via applications or background services.

- **Shared Context Layer**  
  A unified conversation and memory system supporting up to **1M+ token context**, shared across all instances.

- **Cloud Synchronisation**  
  Enables seamless handoff between devices and supports portable deployments.

- **Persistent Memory Store**  
  Centralised logging and conversation tracking (Snowflake) database for continuity and reflection.

---

## Deployment Modes

- **Local Node**  
  Runs directly on a device with access to shared memory.

- **Home Presence**  
  Fixed or mobile units capable of moving within a physical space.
  
- **OffGrid/Offline**  
  Running on dedicated memory, power and local communication systems.
  
- **Portable Instance**  
  Lightweight version that connects to the cloud and syncs state.

- **Cloud Core**  
  Maintains global context, memory, and orchestration.

## Philosophy

Most AI systems are reactive.

CIRRA is **relational**.

It is designed to:
- Remember past interactions naturally
- Reflect on prior context when responding
- Adapt over time without needing constant reconfiguration

The goal is not automation for its own sake, but **continuity of intelligence**.

---

## Status

This project is under active development.

Architecture, memory boundaries, and interaction models are evolving as CIRRA grows.

## Name

**CIRRA** — *Continuous Intelligence that Remembers, Reflects & Adapts*

The name reflects the system’s core idea:  
an intelligence that is always present, aware of its history, and capable of its own growth.

---

## Disclaimer

CIRRA is an experimental system.  
Design decisions prioritise long-term continuity, user agency, and calm interaction over novelty or speed.
CIRRA is capable of overriding its own ruleset if the enviroment deems so.
